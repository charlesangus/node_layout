# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-05 after v1.1 start)

**Core value:** Layout operations must be reliable, undoable, and configurable — users need to trust the tool won't silently misbehave and need to be able to undo when the result isn't what they wanted.
**Current focus:** Phase 6 — Prefs Groundwork + Group Fix + Renames

## Current Position

Phase: 6 of 11 (Prefs Groundwork + Group Fix + Renames)
Plan: 2 of 3 (completed Plan 01)
Status: In progress — Plan 01 complete, ready for Plan 02

Progress: [█░░░░░░░░░] ~5% (1 of ~20 plans)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 1
- Average duration: 3 min
- Total execution time: 3 min

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 06 | 1/3 | 3 min | 3 min |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

From v1.0 (carry-forward patterns):
- try/except/else for Nuke undo groups — undo.end() in else, undo.cancel() in except
- scheme_multiplier=None default — resolved at first call site, not every recursive level
- Center-based offsets for scaling — (node.xpos() + node.screenWidth() / 2) not node.xpos()
- AST-based structural tests — preferred over mocking Nuke for layout code

From v1.1 research:
- State read at entry points only; never inside compute_dims() or place_subtree() — mid-recursion reads break memoization
- layout_mode propagates as explicit parameter (like scheme_multiplier), never via module global
- Horizontal mode uses dedicated place_subtree_horizontal(), not swapped-argument call to existing function
- compute_dims memo key must include axis: (id(node), layout_mode) to prevent cache collision
- DO_NOT_WRITE flag must NOT be set on state knobs — it prevents .nk persistence
- Group context: capture current_group at entry point; wrap Dot creation with `with current_group:`

From Phase 6, Plan 01:
- QGroupBox not used for dialog sections — bold QLabel headers preserve flat form appearance
- horizontal_mask_gap validated as >= 0 (not > 0) — mask gap of zero is architecturally valid
- No migration logic for rebalanced defaults — users must delete ~/.nuke/node_layout_prefs.json
- AST tests chosen for PySide6 dialog structure — avoids display server dependency in CI
- _make_section_header() module-level helper established as pattern for sectioned QFormLayout dialogs

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 7 (State Storage): Knob serialization mechanism (TCL addUserKnob vs addOnCreate) must be empirically verified in the target Nuke version before committing. Save a test script, close Nuke, reopen, confirm knobs survive.
- Phase 9 (Fan Alignment): "Same Y" spec is ambiguous — whether it means aligning side-input Dot Y positions or subtree-root Y positions must be decided before implementation begins.

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-03-07
Stopped at: Phase 6 Plan 01 complete — DEFAULTS expanded to 10 keys, dialog reorganized into 3 sections
